## Hydration

> "In React, “hydration” is how React “attaches” to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment. During hydration, React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup and take over rendering the app on the client. In apps fully built with React, you will usually only hydrate one “root”, once at startup for your entire app."
